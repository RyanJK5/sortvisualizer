# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is my rendition of the "sorting algorithm visualization/audibilization" type of program that's become popular on YouTube. A dropdown menu contains a list 
of 13 sorting algorithms to experiment with. The number of elements in the array can be modified to see the effectiveness of sorting algorithms on a variety of
scales. The delay between each action in the algorithm may also be modified to essentially modify the speed of the visualization of the algorithm. The number of
array accesses and comparisons are also displayed for each sorting algorithm.
